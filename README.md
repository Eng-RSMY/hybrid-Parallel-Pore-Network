# hybrid-Parallel-Pore-Network
A hybrid-parallel generic programming model
This is EXPNS, an Exa-scale Pore Network Simulator that has been developed
on a Trilinos-Kokkos-Dakota backend. Trilinos provides large scale distributed
parallelism, Kokkos provides open-mp/CUDA hybrid parallelism and performance portability
while Dakota provides the Network with uncertainty quantification capabilities. Check out 
our papers in my website to understand how this works.
