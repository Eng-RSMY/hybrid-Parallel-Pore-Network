# hybrid-Parallel-Pore-Network

This is EXPNS, an Exa-scale Pore Network Simulator that has been developed
on a Trilinos-Kokkos-Dakota backend. Trilinos provides large scale distributed
parallelism, Kokkos provides OpenMP/CUDA hybrid parallelism and performance portability
while Dakota provides the Network with uncertainty quantification capabilities. Check out 
our papers on my website to understand how this works.
